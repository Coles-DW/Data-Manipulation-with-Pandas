## Sorting and Subsetting
Sorting rows
Finding interesting bits of data in a DataFrame is often easier if you change the order of the rows. You can sort the rows by passing a column name to .sort_values().

In cases where rows have the same value (this is common if you sort on a categorical variable), you may wish to break the ties by sorting on another column. You can sort on multiple columns in this way by passing a list of column names.

Sort on …	Syntax
one column	df.sort_values("breed")
multiple columns	df.sort_values(["breed", "weight_kg"])
By combining .sort_values() with .head(), you can answer questions in the form, "What are the top cases where…?".

homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

# Sort homelessness by individuals
homelessness_ind = homelessness.sort_values("individuals")

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_ind.head())

# Sort homelessness by descending family members
homelessness_fam = homelessness.sort_values("family_members", ascending=False)

print(homelessness_fam.head())

# Sort homelessness by region, then descending family members
homelessness_reg_fam = homelessness.sort_values(["region", "family_members"], ascending=[True, False])

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_reg_fam.head())

## Subsetting columns
When working with data, you may not need all of the variables in your dataset. Square brackets ([]) can be used to select only the columns that matter to you in an order that makes sense to you. To select only "col_a" of the DataFrame df, use

df["col_a"]
To select "col_a" and "col_b" of df, use

df[["col_a", "col_b"]]
homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

# Select the individuals column
individuals = homelessness["individuals"]

print(individuals.head())

# Select the state and family_members columns
state_fam = homelessness[["state", "family_members"]]

print(state_fam.head())

# Select only the individuals and state columns, in that order
ind_state = homelessness[["individuals", "state"]]

print(ind_state.head())

##Subsetting rows
A large part of data science is about finding which bits of your dataset are interesting. One of the simplest techniques for this is to find a subset of rows that match some criteria. This is sometimes known as filtering rows or selecting rows.

There are many ways to subset a DataFrame, perhaps the most common is to use relational operators to return True or False for each row, then pass that inside square brackets.

dogs[dogs["height_cm"] > 60]
dogs[dogs["color"] == "tan"]
You can filter for multiple conditions at once by using the "bitwise and" operator, &.

dogs[(dogs["height_cm"] > 60) & (dogs["color"] == "tan")]

homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd

# Filter for rows where individuals is greater than 10000
ind_gt_10k = homelessness[homelessness["individuals"] > 10000]

# See the result
print(ind_gt_10k)

# Filter for rows where region is Mountain
mountain_reg = homelessness[homelessness["region"] == "Mountain"]

# See the result
print(mountain_reg)

# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000 
# and region is Pacific
fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness["family_members"] < 1000) & (homelessness["region"] == "Pacific")]

# See the result
print(fam_lt_1k_pac)

## Subsetting rows by categorical variables
Subsetting data based on a categorical variable often involves using the or operator (|) to select rows from multiple categories. This can get tedious when you want all states in one of three different regions, for example. Instead, use the .isin() method, which will allow you to tackle this problem by writing one condition instead of three separate ones.

colors = ["brown", "black", "tan"]
condition = dogs["color"].isin(colors)
dogs[condition]
homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

# The Mojave Desert states
canu = ["California", "Arizona", "Nevada", "Utah"]

# Filter for rows in the Mojave Desert states
condition = homelessness["state"].isin(canu)
mojave_homelessness = homelessness[condition]


# See the result
print(mojave_homelessness)

## Adding new columns
You aren't stuck with just the data you are given. Instead, you can add new columns to a DataFrame. This has many names, such as transforming, mutating, and feature engineering.

You can create new columns from scratch, but it is also common to derive them from other columns, for example, by adding columns together or by changing their units.

homelessness is a DataFrame containing estimates of homelessness in each U.S. state in 2018. The individual column is the number of homeless individuals not part of a family with children. The family_members column is the number of homeless individuals part of a family with children. The state_pop column is the state's total population.

homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

# Add total col as sum of individuals and family_members
homelessness["total"] = homelessness["individuals"] + homelessness["family_members"]

# Add p_homeless col as proportion of total homeless population to the state population
homelessness["p_homeless"] = homelessness["total"]/homelessness["state_pop"]

# See the result
print(homelessness)

## Combo-attack!
You've seen the four most common types of data manipulation: sorting rows, subsetting columns, subsetting rows, and adding new columns. In a real-life data analysis, you can mix and match these four manipulations to answer a multitude of questions.

In this exercise, you'll answer the question, "Which state has the highest number of homeless individuals per 10,000 people in the state?" Combine your new pandas skills to find out.

# Create indiv_per_10k col as homeless individuals per 10k state pop
homelessness["indiv_per_10k"] = 10000 * homelessness["individuals"] / homelessness["state_pop"] 

# Subset rows for indiv_per_10k greater than 20
high_homelessness = homelessness[homelessness["indiv_per_10k"] > 20]

# Sort high_homelessness by descending indiv_per_10k
high_homelessness_srt = high_homelessness.sort_values("indiv_per_10k", ascending = False)

# From high_homelessness_srt, select the state and indiv_per_10k cols
result = high_homelessness_srt[["state", "indiv_per_10k"]]

# See the result
print(result)
