Pivoting on one variable
Pivot tables are the standard way of aggregating data in spreadsheets.

In pandas, pivot tables are essentially another way of performing grouped calculations. That is, the .pivot_table() method is an alternative to .groupby().

In this exercise, you'll perform calculations using .pivot_table() to replicate the calculations you performed in the last lesson using .groupby().

sales is available and pandas is imported as pd.

# Pivot for mean weekly_sales for each store type
mean_sales_by_type = sales.pivot_table(values="weekly_sales", index="type")

# Print mean_sales_by_type
print(mean_sales_by_type)

# Pivot for mean and median weekly_sales for each store type
mean_med_sales_by_type = sales.pivot_table(values="weekly_sales", index="type", aggfunc=["mean", "median"])

# Print mean_med_sales_by_type
print(mean_med_sales_by_type)

# Pivot for mean weekly_sales by store type and holiday 
mean_sales_by_type_holiday = sales.pivot_table(values="weekly_sales", index="type", columns="is_holiday")

# Print mean_sales_by_type_holiday
print(mean_sales_by_type_holiday)

Fill in missing values and sum values with pivot tables
The .pivot_table() method has several useful arguments, including fill_value and margins.

fill_value replaces missing values with a real value (known as imputation). What to replace missing values with is a topic big enough to have its own course (Dealing with Missing Data in Python), but the simplest thing to do is to substitute a dummy value.
margins is a shortcut for when you pivoted by two variables, but also wanted to pivot by each of those variables separately: it gives the row and column totals of the pivot table contents.
In this exercise, you'll practice using these arguments to up your pivot table skills, which will help you crunch numbers more efficiently!

# Print mean weekly_sales by department and type; fill missing values with 0
print(sales.pivot_table(values="weekly_sales", index="department", columns="type", fill_value=0))

# Print the mean weekly_sales by department and type; fill missing values with 0s; sum all rows and cols
print(sales.pivot_table(values="weekly_sales", index="department", columns="type", fill_value=0, margins=True))
