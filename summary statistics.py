Mean and median
Summary statistics are exactly what they sound like - they summarize many numbers in one statistic. For example, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation are summary statistics. Calculating summary statistics allows you to get a better sense of your data, even if there's a lot of it.

sales is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

# Print the head of the sales DataFrame
print(sales.head())

# Print the info about the sales DataFrame
print(sales.info())

# Print the mean of weekly_sales
print(sales["weekly_sales"].mean())

# Print the median of weekly_sales
print(sales["weekly_sales"].median())

# Print the maximum of the date column
print(sales["date"].max())

# Print the minimum of the date column
print(sales["date"].min())


## Efficient summaries
While pandas and NumPy have tons of functions, sometimes, you may need a different function to summarize your data.

The .agg() method allows you to apply your own custom functions to a DataFrame, as well as apply functions to more than one column of a DataFrame at once, making your aggregations super-efficient. For example,

df['column'].agg(function)
In the custom function for this exercise, "IQR" is short for inter-quartile range, which is the 75th percentile minus the 25th percentile. It's an alternative to standard deviation that is helpful if your data contains outliers.

sales is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

# A custom IQR function
def iqr(column):
    return column.quantile(0.75) - column.quantile(0.25)
    
# Print IQR of the temperature_c column
print(sales["temperature_c"].agg(iqr))

# Update to print IQR of temperature_c, fuel_price_usd_per_l, & unemployment
print(sales[["temperature_c", "fuel_price_usd_per_l", "unemployment"]].agg(iqr))

# Update to print IQR and median of temperature_c, fuel_price_usd_per_l, & unemployment
print(sales[["temperature_c", "fuel_price_usd_per_l", "unemployment"]].agg([iqr, "median"]))

                                                                                 Cumulative statistics
Cumulative statistics can also be helpful in tracking summary statistics over time. In this exercise, you'll calculate the cumulative sum and cumulative max of a department's weekly sales, which will allow you to identify what the total sales were so far as well as what the highest weekly sales were so far.

A DataFrame called sales_1_1 has been created for you, which contains the sales data for department 1 of store 1. pandas is loaded as pd.
