Your first inner join
You have been tasked with figuring out what the most popular types of fuel used in Chicago taxis are. To complete the analysis, you need to merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables together on the vid column. You can then use the merged table along with the .value_counts() method to find the most common fuel_type.

Since you'll be working with pandas throughout the course, the package will be preloaded for you as pd in each exercise in this course. Also the taxi_owners and taxi_veh DataFrames are loaded for you.

# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on="vid")

# Print the column names of the taxi_own_veh
print(taxi_own_veh.columns)

# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables setting a suffix
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid', suffixes=('_own', '_veh'))

# Print the column names of taxi_own_veh
print(taxi_own_veh.columns)

# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables setting a suffix
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid', suffixes=('_own','_veh'))

# Print the value_counts to find the most popular fuel_type
print(taxi_own_veh['fuel_type'].value_counts())

Inner joins and number of rows returned
All of the merges you have studied to this point are called inner joins. It is necessary to understand that inner joins only return the rows with matching values in both tables. You will explore this further by reviewing the merge between the wards and census tables, then comparing it to merges of copies of these tables that are slightly altered, named wards_altered, and census_altered. The first row of the wards column has been changed in the altered tables. You will examine how this affects the merge between them. The tables have been loaded for you.

For this exercise, it is important to know that the wards and census tables start with 50 rows.

# Merge the wards and census tables on the ward column
wards_census = wards.merge(census, on='ward')

# Print the shape of wards_census
print('wards_census table shape:', wards_census.shape)\

# Print the first few rows of the wards_altered table to view the change 
print(wards_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards_altered and census tables on the ward column
wards_altered_census = wards_altered.merge(census, on='ward')

# Print the shape of wards_altered_census
print('wards_altered_census table shape:', wards_altered_census.shape)

# Print the first few rows of the census_altered table to view the change 
print(census_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards and census_altered tables on the ward column
wards_census_altered = wards.merge(census_altered, on='ward')

# Print the shape of wards_census_altered
print('wards_census_altered table shape:', wards_census_altered.shape)

Great job! In step 1, the .merge() returned a table with the same number of rows as the original wards table. However, in steps 2 and 3, using the altered tables with the altered first row of the ward column, the number of returned rows was fewer. There was not a matching value in the ward column of the other table. _Remember that .merge() only returns rows where the values match in both tables._
One-to-many merge
A business may have one or multiple owners. In this exercise, you will continue to gain experience with one-to-many merges by merging a table of business owners, called biz_owners, to the licenses table. Recall from the video lesson, with a one-to-many relationship, a row in the left table may be repeated if it is related to multiple rows in the right table. In this lesson, you will explore this further by finding out what is the most common business owner title. (i.e., secretary, CEO, or vice president)

The licenses and biz_owners DataFrames are loaded for you.

licenses.head()
biz_owners.head()

# Merge the licenses and biz_owners table on account
licenses_owners = licenses.merge(biz_owners, on="account")
print(licenses_owners.head())

# Group the results by title then count the number of accounts
counted_df = licenses_owners.groupby("title").agg({'account':'count'})

print(counted_df.head())

# Sort the counted_df in descending order
sorted_df = counted_df.sort_values("account", ascending=False)

# Use .head() method to print the first few rows of sorted_df
print(sorted_df.head())

# You see that president, followed by secretary, are the most common business owner titles.

Total riders in a month
Your goal is to find the total number of rides provided to passengers passing through the Wilson station (station_name == 'Wilson') when riding Chicago's public transportation system on weekdays (day_type == 'Weekday') in July (month == 7). Luckily, Chicago provides this detailed data, but it is in three different tables. You will work on merging these tables together to answer the question. This data is different from the business related data you have seen so far, but all the information you need to answer the question is provided.

The cal, ridership, and stations DataFrames have been loaded for you. The relationship between the tables can be seen in the diagram below.

Table diagram. The cal table relates to ridership via year, month, and day. The ridership table relates to the stations table via station_id.

cal.head()
ridership.head()

# Merge the ridership and cal tables
ridership_cal = ridership.merge(cal, on=["year", "month", "day"])

print(ridership_cal.head())

ridership.head()
stations.head()

# Merge the ridership, cal, and stations tables
ridership_cal_stations = ridership.merge(cal, on=['year','month','day']) \
            				.merge(stations, on="station_id")

print(ridership_cal_stations.head())

# Merge the ridership, cal, and stations tables
ridership_cal_stations = ridership.merge(cal, on=['year','month','day']) \
							.merge(stations, on='station_id')

# Create a filter to filter ridership_cal_stations
filter_criteria = ((ridership_cal_stations['month'] == 7) 
                   & (ridership_cal_stations['day_type'] == 'Weekday') 
                   & (ridership_cal_stations['station_name'] == 'Wilson'))

# Use .loc and the filter to select for rides
print(ridership_cal_stations.loc[filter_criteria, 'rides'].sum())

Three table merge
To solidify the concept of a three DataFrame merge, practice another exercise. A reasonable extension of our review of Chicago business data would include looking at demographics information about the neighborhoods where the businesses are. A table with the median income by zip code has been provided to you. You will merge the licenses and wards tables with this new income-by-zip-code table called zip_demo.

The licenses, wards, and zip_demo DataFrames have been loaded for you.

licenses.head()
wards.head()
zip_demo.head()

# Merge licenses and zip_demo, on zip; and merge the wards on ward
licenses_zip_ward = licenses.merge(zip_demo, on= "zip") \
            			.merge(wards, on="ward")

print(licenses_zip_ward.head())

# Print the results by alderman and show median income
print(licenses_zip_ward.groupby("alderman").agg({'income':'median'}))

One-to-many merge with multiple tables
In this exercise, assume that you are looking to start a business in the city of Chicago. Your perfect idea is to start a company that uses goats to mow the lawn for other businesses. However, you have to choose a location in the city to put your goat farm. You need a location with a great deal of space and relatively few businesses and people around to avoid complaints about the smell. You will need to merge three tables to help you choose your location. The land_use table has info on the percentage of vacant land by city ward. The census table has population by ward, and the licenses table lists businesses by ward.

The land_use, census, and licenses tables have been loaded for you.

land_use.head()
census.head()
licenses.head()

# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen = land_use.merge(census, on='ward')
land_cen_lic = land_cen.merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes = ('_cen', '_lic'))

print(land_cen_lic.head())

# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use.merge(census, on='ward') \
                    .merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=('_cen','_lic'))

# Group by ward, pop_2010, and vacant, then count the # of accounts
pop_vac_lic = land_cen_lic.groupby([ "ward", "pop_2010","vacant"], 
                                   as_index=False).agg({'account':'count'})
print(pop_vac_lic.head())

# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use.merge(census, on='ward') \
                    .merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=('_cen','_lic'))

# Group by ward, pop_2010, and vacant, then count the # of accounts
pop_vac_lic = land_cen_lic.groupby(['ward','pop_2010','vacant'], 
                                   as_index=False).agg({'account':'count'})

# Sort pop_vac_lic and print the results
sorted_pop_vac_lic = pop_vac_lic.sort_values(["vacant", "account", "pop_2010"], 
                                             ascending= [False, True, True])

# Print the top few rows of sorted_pop_vac_lic
print(sorted_pop_vac_lic.head())

You merged multiple tables with varying relationships and added suffixes to make your column names clearer. Using your skills, you were able to pull together information from different tables to see that the 7th ward would be a good place to build your goat farm!

Counting missing rows with left join
The Movie Database is supported by volunteers going out into the world, collecting data, and entering it into the database. This includes financial data, such as movie budget and revenue. If you wanted to know which movies are still missing data, you could use a left join to identify them. Practice using a left join by merging the movies table and the financials table.

The movies and financials tables have been loaded for you.

# Merge movies and financials with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

print(movies_financials.head())
print(movies_financials.shape)

# Merge the movies table with the financials table with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Count the number of rows in the budget column that are missing
number_of_missing_fin = movies_financials['budget'].isnull().sum()

# Print the number of movies missing financials
print(number_of_missing_fin)

Enriching a dataset
Setting how='left' with the .merge()method is a useful technique for enriching or enhancing a dataset with additional information from a different table. In this exercise, you will start off with a sample of movie data from the movie series Toy Story. Your goal is to enrich this data by adding the marketing tag line for each movie. You will compare the results of a left join versus an inner join.

The toy_story DataFrame contains the Toy Story movies. The toy_story and taglines DataFrames have been loaded for you.

# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a left join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id', how='left')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)

# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a inner join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)

How many rows with a left join?
Select the true statement about left joins.

Try running the following code statements:

left_table.merge(one_to_one, on='id', how='left').shape
left_table.merge(one_to_many, on='id', how='left').shape
Note that the left_table starts out with 4 rows.

Right join to find unique movies
Most of the recent big-budget science fiction movies can also be classified as action movies. You are given a table of science fiction movies called scifi_movies and another table of action movies called action_movies. Your goal is to find which movies are considered only science fiction movies. Once you have this table, you can merge the movies table in to see the movie names. Since this exercise is related to science fiction movies, use a right join as your superhero power to solve this problem.

The movies, scifi_movies, and action_movies tables have been loaded for you.

# Merge action_movies to scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right')

# Merge action_movies to scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes= ['_act', '_sci'])

# Print the first few rows of action_scifi to see the structure
print(action_scifi.head())

# Merge action_movies to the scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes=('_act','_sci'))

# From action_scifi, select only the rows where the genre_act column is null
scifi_only = action_scifi[action_scifi["genre_act"].isnull()]

print(scifi_only)

# Merge action_movies to the scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes=('_act','_sci'))

# From action_scifi, select only the rows where the genre_act column is null
scifi_only = action_scifi[action_scifi['genre_act'].isnull()]

# Merge the movies and scifi_only tables with an inner join
movies_and_scifi_only = movies.merge(scifi_only, left_on='id', right_on='movie_id')

# Print the first few rows and shape of movies_and_scifi_only
print(movies_and_scifi_only.head())
print(movies_and_scifi_only.shape)

you found over 250 action only movies by merging action_movies and scifi_movies using a right join. With this, you were able to find the rows not found in the action_movies table. Additionally, you used the left_on and right_on arguments to merge in the movies table. 


Popular genres with right join
What are the genres of the most popular movies? To answer this question, you need to merge data from the movies and movie_to_genres tables. In a table called pop_movies, the top 10 most popular movies in the movies table have been selected. To ensure that you are analyzing all of the popular movies, merge it with the movie_to_genres table using a right join. To complete your analysis, count the number of different genres. Also, the two tables can be merged by the movie ID. However, in pop_movies that column is called id, and in movie_to_genres it's called movie_id.

The pop_movies and movie_to_genres tables have been loaded for you.

# Use right join to merge the movie_to_genres and pop_movies tables
genres_movies = movie_to_genres.merge(pop_movies, how='right', 
                                      left_on='movie_id', 
                                      right_on='id')

print(genres_movies.head())

# Count the number of genres
genre_count = genres_movies.groupby('genre').agg({'id':'count'})

# Plot a bar chart of the genre_count
genre_count.plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()

Using outer join to select actors
One cool aspect of using an outer join is that, because it returns all rows from both merged tables and null where they do not match, you can use it to find rows that do not have a match in the other table. To try for yourself, you have been given two tables with a list of actors from two popular movies: Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 2. Most of the actors played in both movies. Use an outer join to find actors who did not act in both movies.

The Iron Man 1 table is called iron_1_actors, and Iron Man 2 table is called iron_2_actors. Both tables have been loaded for you and a few rows printed so you can see the structure.

Venn graph with no overlap

# Merge iron_1_actors to iron_2_actors on id with outer join using suffixes
iron_1_and_2 = iron_1_actors.merge(iron_2_actors,
                                     on='id',
                                     how='outer',
                                     suffixes=['_1','_2'])

print(iron_1_and_2.head())

# Create an index that returns true if name_1 or name_2 are null
m = ((iron_1_and_2['name_1'].isnull()) | 
     (iron_1_and_2['name_2'].isnull()))

# Print the first few rows of iron_1_and_2
print(iron_1_and_2[m].head())

Self join
Merging a table to itself can be useful when you want to compare values in a column to other values in the same column. In this exercise, you will practice this by creating a table that for each movie will list the movie director and a member of the crew on one row. You have been given a table called crews, which has columns id, job, and name. First, merge the table to itself using the movie ID. This merge will give you a larger table where for each movie, every job is matched against each other. Then select only those rows with a director in the left table, and avoid having a row where the director's job is listed in both the left and right tables. This filtering will remove job combinations that aren't with the director.

The crews table has been loaded for you.

# Merge the crews table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id', suffixes=['_dir', '_crew'])

print(crews_self_merged.head())

# Merge the crews table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id', how='inner',
                                suffixes=('_dir','_crew'))

# Create a Boolean index to select the appropriate
boolean_filter = ((crews_self_merged['job_dir'] == 'Director') & 
     (crews_self_merged['job_crew'] != 'Director'))
direct_crews = crews_self_merged[boolean_filter]

# Print the first few rows of direct_crews
print(direct_crews.head())

By merging the table to itself, you compared the value of the __director__ from the jobs column to other values from the jobs column. With the output, you can quickly see different movie directors and the people they worked with in the same movie.

Index merge for movie ratings
To practice merging on indexes, you will merge movies and a table called ratings that holds info about movie ratings. Ensure that your merge returns all rows from the movies table, and only matching rows from the ratings table.

The movies and ratings tables have been loaded for you.

# Merge to the movies table the ratings table on the index
movies_ratings = movies.merge(ratings, on='id')

# Print the first few rows of movies_ratings
print(movies_ratings.head())

Merging on indexes is just like merging on columns, so if you need to merge based on indexes, there's no need to turn the indexes into columns first.

Do sequels earn more?
It is time to put together many of the aspects that you have learned in this chapter. In this exercise, you'll find out which movie sequels earned the most compared to the original movie. To answer this question, you will merge a modified version of the sequels and financials tables where their index is the movie ID. You will need to choose a merge type that will return all of the rows from the sequels table and not all the rows of financials table need to be included in the result. From there, you will join the resulting table to itself so that you can compare the revenue values of the original movie to the sequel. Next, you will calculate the difference between the two revenues and sort the resulting dataset.

The sequels and financials tables have been provided.

# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on sequel and right on id
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how='inner', left_on='sequel', 
                             right_on='id', right_index=True,
                             suffixes=['_org','_seq'])

# Add calculation to subtract revenue_org from revenue_seq 
orig_seq['diff'] = orig_seq['revenue_seq'] - orig_seq['revenue_org']

# Select the title_org, title_seq, and diff 
titles_diff = (orig_seq[["title_org", "title_seq", "diff"]])

# Print the first rows of the sorted titles_diff
print(titles_diff.sort_values(by='diff', ascending=False).head())

To complete this exercise, you needed to merge tables on their index and merge another table to itself. After the calculations were added and sub-select specific columns, the data was sorted. You found out that Jurassic World had one of the highest of all, improvement in revenue compared to the original movie.
